This is an endpoint implemented with Java Fuseki.

## Running
To run this project, clone it and then open it in Eclipse IDE

### Server
- Open `src/main/java/Endpoint.java` and run it in Eclipse.
- This should start a server that runs on `http://localhost:3330/`.
- The Value Map Ontology dataset will be avaliable on `http://localhost:3330/valuemapontology`

### Client
- This Eclipse project also comes with a client that will attempt to query the ontology with a set of predefined SELECT, ASK, CONSTRUCT, and DESCRIBE queries when run.
- To do so, open `src/main/java/Client.java` and run it after the server has started.
